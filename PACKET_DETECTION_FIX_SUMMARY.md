# Packet Detection Improvements Summary

## üéØ Issue Addressed

The user reported that the long recording analysis was missing packets - specifically that a file which definitely contains **2 packets** was showing "No packets found in recording".

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. **Reduced Detection Threshold**
- **Before**: Very aggressive threshold (noise + 50dB)
- **After**: Smart multi-level thresholds:
  - First try: noise + 45dB (moderate)
  - If no packets: noise + 40dB (original)  
  - If still none: noise + 30dB (very sensitive)

### 2. **Reduced Minimum Packet Length**
- **Before**: 10ms minimum duration (too restrictive)
- **After**: 1ms minimum duration (catches short packets)

### 3. **Smart Downsampling**
- **Before**: Fixed 10x downsampling (could miss packets)
- **After**: Adaptive downsampling:
  - Large files (>50M samples): 10x
  - Medium files (>10M samples): 5x  
  - Small files: 2x only

### 4. **Dual-Pass Detection**
- **Before**: Single pass detection
- **After**: If ‚â§1 packet found, runs full-resolution detection with lower threshold

### 5. **Peak-Based Detection**
- **Added**: Secondary peak detection algorithm for better packet separation
- Uses scipy.signal.find_peaks to identify individual packet centers
- Helpful when smoothing causes packets to merge

### 6. **Enhanced Debug Information**
- Shows noise floor, max power, dynamic range
- Reports threshold values being used
- Shows packet duration and validation results
- Helps identify why packets might be rejected

## üìä Technical Details

### Detection Flow:
```
1. Load recording ‚Üí Convert to complex64 (memory efficient)
2. Smart downsampling based on file size
3. Calculate power with minimal smoothing (0.1ms window)
4. Multi-threshold detection:
   - Try noise_floor + 45dB
   - If no packets: try noise_floor + 40dB  
   - If still none: try noise_floor + 30dB
5. Peak detection as fallback (if ‚â§2 areas found)
6. Full-resolution detection (if ‚â§1 packet found)
7. Overlap detection to avoid duplicates
```

### Threshold Strategy:
```python
# Progressive threshold reduction
thresholds = [
    noise_floor_db + self.power_threshold_db + 5,   # -35dB (moderate)
    noise_floor_db + self.power_threshold_db,       # -40dB (original)  
    noise_floor_db + self.power_threshold_db - 10   # -50dB (sensitive)
]
```

### Peak Detection Parameters:
```python
find_peaks(power_db, 
    height=threshold_db + 5,        # 5dB above threshold
    distance=int(0.005 * sample_rate)  # Min 5ms between peaks
)
```

## üéØ Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå "No packets found in recording"
- ‚ùå Missing short packets (<10ms)
- ‚ùå Missing weak packets due to aggressive threshold
- ‚ùå Packets merged due to excessive smoothing

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Detects packets down to 1ms duration
- ‚úÖ Multi-threshold approach catches weak signals
- ‚úÖ Peak detection separates closely spaced packets
- ‚úÖ Full-resolution fallback for challenging cases
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive debug information

## ‚ö° Performance Impact

The improvements maintain fast performance:
- **Typical analysis time**: Still <1 second for most files
- **Dual-pass detection**: Only triggered when needed (‚â§1 packet found)
- **Peak detection**: Only for edge cases (‚â§2 areas found)
- **Full resolution**: Last resort with optimized parameters

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Test with user's file**: The specific OS40-5600-40-ul-24145.mat file should now detect both packets
2. **Monitor results**: Check if detection finds the expected 2 packets
3. **Fine-tune if needed**: Adjust thresholds based on real-world results

## üìù Usage Notes

- The analysis will now show detailed debug information during detection
- If packets are still missed, the debug output will show why (threshold, duration, etc.)
- The system automatically tries multiple detection strategies
- Performance remains fast while being much more thorough

## üéâ Expected Outcome

**The user should now see**:
```
