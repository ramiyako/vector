```python
def create_spectrogram(
    sig, 
    sr, 
    center_freq=0, 
    max_samples=2_000_000,      # Increased from 1M
    time_resolution_us=1,       # Improved from 10μs  
    adaptive_resolution=True    # New adaptive feature
):
```

```python  
def normalize_spectrogram(
    Sxx, 
    low_percentile=10.0,        # Now accepts float values
    high_percentile=98.0,       # Now accepts float values
    max_dynamic_range=60
):
```
